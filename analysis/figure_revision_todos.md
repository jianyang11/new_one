# BREEZE Figure Revision Todos

Status: preview package complete except the documented Figure 6 freeze blocker
Baseline: `origin/main@621dfe7`
Backend: Python/matplotlib only
Formal integration gate: blocked until explicit author approval of previews

## A. Freeze scope and runtime

- [x] Verify local `main` and `origin/main` both resolve to `621dfe7`.
- [x] Confirm tracked manuscript and figure sources are clean at task start.
- [x] Preserve all unrelated untracked experiment and build artifacts.
- [x] Read `nature-figure/SKILL.md`, its manifest, core contract, stance,
  Python backend fragment, chart patterns, Nature observations, and QA contract.
- [x] Read the local Nuwa skill and adopt its topic-skill synthesis discipline:
  primary-source collection, cross-source pattern extraction, explicit
  anti-patterns, and honest boundaries.
- [x] Read the complete `main_cas.tex`, `src/figures.py`, and
  `src/figure_style.py` at the synchronized baseline.
- [x] Verify `.venv-breeze` Python, matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, pandas, Pillow,
  scikit-learn, and required vector/raster export support.
- [x] Freeze hashes for the manuscript, current result figures, plotting code,
  and every candidate formal data source.
- [x] Create `paper/figs/revision_preview/` without touching formal figure files.

## B. Literature and visual grammar benchmark

- [x] Select 5--8 real, recent papers spanning fault-data generation,
  physics-informed generation, diffusion/GAN augmentation, and BearGen.
- [x] Verify each paper through a publisher page, DOI record, or authoritative
  preprint; reject records without stable primary provenance.
- [x] Inspect each paper's main result figures rather than relying on abstracts.
- [x] Record dataset/task, comparison structure, uncertainty display, statistical
  annotation, physical-evidence organization, and failure/boundary treatment.
- [x] Distill cross-paper expert rules using the Nuwa synthesis pattern:
  recurring mental models, decision heuristics, anti-patterns, and scope limits.
- [x] Write the verified benchmark to `analysis/figure_style_benchmark.md` with
  source links and concrete BREEZE adaptations.

## C. Source-data and claim audit

- [x] Inventory every current Fig. 3--10 source path used by `src/figures.py`.
- [x] Separate formal/frozen sources from smoke, partial, development, ignored,
  or unavailable sources.
- [x] Exclude TimeGAN, DDPM, CFG-DDPM, strong physics generators, and additional
  classifier backbones from all preview figures.
- [x] Exclude private machine-tool data and retain only PU, CWRU, and Berkeley.
- [x] Map every plotted number to frozen CSV/NPZ rows and the generating script.
- [x] Verify train/test provenance for all waveform selection and statistics.
- [x] Verify paired seed definitions and synthetic-pool reuse for downstream
  confidence intervals.
- [x] Audit Holm status sources for every dataset/shot/metric/comparator cell.
- [x] Audit whether cumulative K=0/1/2/3 slot admission can be reconstructed
  exactly from frozen slot/candidate records; stop Fig. 6a if it cannot.
- [x] Audit physical-metric availability per dataset/method/class, especially
  kurtosis-W1 and fault-frequency alignment.
- [x] Write `analysis/figure_source_map.md` before plotting.

## D. Figure contracts

- [x] Write a one-sentence conclusion, evidence hierarchy, archetype, panel map,
  statistics contract, source-data requirement, and reviewer risk for Fig. 3.
- [x] Write the same contract for Fig. 4, including medoid provenance and
  population envelope-spectrum summary.
- [x] Write the same contract for Fig. 5, separating fidelity errors from
  directionless NN diversity.
- [x] Write the same contract for Fig. 6, including the capacity-failure encoding.
- [x] Write the same contract for Fig. 7, separating continuous CWRU effects from
  discrete PU pass states.
- [x] Freeze the common 183 mm style, palette, typography, line widths, panel
  labels, legend rules, and export formats before implementation.

## E. Data snapshot builder

- [x] Implement a preview-only data builder with deterministic outputs and no
  experiment/API execution.
- [x] Build Fig. 3 paired-effect snapshot with mean paired effect, paired
  bootstrap 95% CI, Holm status, and seed count for all 36 cells.
- [x] Fix the bootstrap algorithm and RNG seed; document resampling over paired
  downstream seeds, not independent generated pools.
- [x] Build Fig. 4 medoid-selection snapshot from outer-training-side physical
  features only; record selected indices, source/unit identifiers, distances,
  and feature definitions.
- [x] Build Fig. 4 population envelope-spectrum median/IQR snapshot for OR and IR
  across Real, LLM, Rule, and Random.
- [x] Build Supplementary Fig. S2 healthy medoid waveform and population
  envelope-spectrum snapshot under the identical selection/demodulation rules.
- [x] Build Supplementary Fig. S1 RMS/kurtosis distribution snapshot with real
  and synthetic sample counts.
- [x] Build Fig. 5 class-conditional physical error-ratio snapshot as
  `log2(method distance / rule distance)` without averaging away unavailable
  or unfavourable cells.
- [x] Build Fig. 5 NN-diversity snapshot separately in raw units.
- [ ] **BLOCKED:** Build Fig. 6 cumulative-round admission, final source admission, and
  gate-by-class non-exclusive failure snapshots.
- [x] Build Fig. 7 CWRU continuous effect/Holm snapshot and PU v1/v2 discrete
  pass-count snapshot.
- [x] Build Supplementary Fig. S3 v1--v6 failure-chain snapshot from frozen
  reports without converting development stops into held-out results.
- [x] Emit one independent source-data CSV per complete figure and supplementary figure.
- [x] Emit one `source-manifest.json` per figure containing source paths,
  SHA-256, filters, sample counts, generation time, and code version.

## F. Tests before plotting

- [x] Test first-row shared x limits and explicitly declared second-row limits.
- [x] Test medoid selection is deterministic and never reads held-out/test rows.

- [x] Test no per-method waveform amplitude normalization is represented as
  absolute-amplitude evidence.
- [x] Test Fig. 5 ratio signs and NA propagation; reject zero/negative distances.
