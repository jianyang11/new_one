# BREEZE final closure checklist

Last verified: 2026-07-17 Asia/Shanghai

## Narrative strengthening: generation, control, and utility

- [x] Abstract is a six-sentence, 219-word account of the engineering problem,
  training-free generation mechanism, physical evidence, paired downstream
  utility, transfer boundary, and operating-point significance.
- [x] Abstract, Introduction, contributions, Discussion, and Conclusion identify
  BREEZE as a synthetic fault-data generation framework; none reduces the
  method to a stand-alone admission or audit tool.
- [x] The verifier is described as generation-loop quality control that admits,
  rejects, and returns bounded recipe feedback; the admitted synthetic pool is
  the evaluated framework output.
- [x] Training-free is limited to removal of target-specific generator fitting
  and LLM fine-tuning from augmentation. Real training-fold calibration and
  downstream classifier training remain explicit.
- [x] The LLM claim is prompt-supported, LLM-mediated recipe selection from
  supplied kinematics, training statistics, and exemplar descriptions; no
  autonomous pretrained-physics claim is made.
- [x] Physical controllability, sample-level auditability, and empirical
  physical-fidelity diagnostics remain distinct concepts.
- [x] PU physical evidence leads with lower class-averaged RMS-W1, PSD-W1, and
  band-energy error than rule and random open-loop sources, while all
  comparator-favouring kurtosis, alignment, and per-class cells remain visible.
- [x] Matched TimeGAN/DDPM absence appears once as a limitation and supports no
  trained-generator performance or cost ranking.

## Hard-error and claim audit

- [x] H1: the manuscript defines separate interval, upper, and lower predicates;
  `breeze/tests/test_paper_gate_semantics.py` checks the paper predicate against
  the implemented gate semantics.
- [x] H2: synthetic-to-real NRMSE, maximum cross-correlation, and byte identity
  are reported separately from within-pool diversity; Berkeley exemplar
  background is disclosed.
- [x] H3: kurtosis-W1 and fault-frequency-alignment cells are retained,
  including comparator-favouring cells; the prose states that LLM is not best
  on every physical metric.
- [x] H4: the plotted PU reference population matches the full class-matched
  outer-training population used by the W1 audit.
- [x] H5: global BH sensitivity accompanies family-wise Holm; seeds and the
  fixed-pool inference unit are explicit; random open-loop is not called a
  matched control.
- [x] Claims remain bounded to training-free, auditable LLM-mediated recipe
  selection under the three frozen public few-shot protocols. No SOTA,
  trained-generator superiority, zero-real-data, formal physical correctness,
  cross-specimen, or cross-machine claim is made.
- [x] Berkeley is reported as 12/12 against non-structured comparators and as a
  small, metric-specific lower-shot advantage over rule, with ten-shot
  convergence.
- [x] TimeGAN/DDPM formal comparison remains one concentrated limitation; smoke
  values are absent from claims.

## Admission-mechanism evidence and figure

- [x] All 450 local round JSON files have a committed SHA-256 manifest.
- [x] First-pass aggregation is strict: selected candidate equals the minimum
  archived round with `feasible=true` for every slot.
- [x] The aggregate has 450 unique slots, 150 per class, and exactly 286 final
  admissions, matching the old frozen `slot_summary.csv` row by row.
- [x] K=0--3 cumulative admissions are 205, 241, 268, and 286; no archive-depth
  proxy, imputation, or inferred round is used.
- [x] The admission figure exports editable PDF/SVG, 300-dpi PNG, and 600-dpi
  TIFF at 183 mm width; source and output hashes pass manifest QA.
- [x] Color, grayscale, CAS reading-size, clipping, and label-overlap checks
  pass. The revision-contract Fig. 6 is formal Figure 7 in the compiled paper
  because the manuscript retains the separate physical-distance figure.
- [x] The formal `acceptance_k.pdf`, Results prose, caption, generated numerical
  macros, evidence ledger, and submission checklist are synchronized.

## Build and release

- [x] `build_paper_tables.py` regenerates all LaTeX numbers from frozen CSV/JSON
  inputs and asserts the new round-level counts.
- [x] Figure exports are byte-deterministic across two consecutive runs.
- [x] `breeze/tests/test_figure_revision_preview.py`: 9/9 passed.
- [x] CAS compilation completed with 21 pages, 46 resolved references, and no
  unresolved citation or cross-reference.
- [x] All 21 PDF pages were rendered and visually checked; no blank page,
  clipped figure, overlap, or unreadable caption was found.
- [ ] Author order, affiliations, ORCIDs, corresponding-author email, funding,
  contributions, and approval metadata remain the sole author-supplied blocker.
- [x] Push the audited Fig. 6 commit to PR #2 and verify the remote PR head.
- [x] Merge PR #2 and verify that merge commit `b476646` is present on
  `origin/main`; PR head `fd909a0` is its second parent.
